## 💡 Key Insights

### **Why 3 Databases?**
- **MySQL:** Fast, structured, for transactions (OLTP)
- **MongoDB:** Flexible, scalable, for analytics (OLAP)
- **Blockchain:** Immutable, tamper-proof, for audit trail

### **How Routes Work**
Every URL (like /machines) maps to a Flask route that:
1. Checks if user is logged in
2. Queries database
3. Processes data
4. Returns HTML or JSON

### **How ML Works**
1. Fetches all performance data
2. Runs Isolation Forest algorithm
3. Identifies anomalies
4. Stores results in 3 places
5. Shows in UI with color badges

### **How Blockchain Works**
- Each block contains: Data + Hash of previous block
- If someone changes old data, hashes break
- Tampering is immediately detected
- Provides proof of integrity
